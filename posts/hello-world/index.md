# Hello, World

Welcome to my blog, and I am glad you are here to read my first post.
I had been waiting and weighing on the idea of building this blog for a while now, and finally the time has come to make it live!

I am a Software Engineer by profession, working on managing the API platform and the development of its tooling. My role has a specific name, the DevOps Engineer.
Of course, I like the concepts like Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD and so on. But I am equally passionate about architecture, coding and keen on learning more about it.
I have used Java and JavaScript as part of my work, especially Spring Framework and a bit of Node.js.
I am hoping to learn Go in the future, and currently focusing on understanding the SOLID principles and Software Design Patterns.

That's all about me, now to answer the question of what is in it for you?
Well, my plan is to write about the topics I learn and share my understanding with the readers of this blog.
I would be focusing on breaking down the complex topics into bite size. Additionally, I will try my best to provide enough background and information on a specific topic such that it can be understood by an audience of different knowledge levels.
For instance, I would write about how I built this blog, what was the process and the decisions I had to take, the thinking behind various steps and so on.

The user interface of this blog looks primitive. The navigation is limited and there may exist flaws that I have overlooked.
The reason for it is pretty straightforward, it is my lack of expertise in user interface development. I tried gaining some skills building this blog.
The idea is to improve on the UI skills gradually and thereby enhance the user experience of this blog. For starters, I would like to add an option to select dark mode to help readers who prefer dark mode.
Then I may add a feature for readers to comment. As you can already see, I have ideas in the backlog which would improve the existing state of the blog.

If you have made it this far, I thank you for your time and hope you will be back to read future posts.
Until then, best regards.
